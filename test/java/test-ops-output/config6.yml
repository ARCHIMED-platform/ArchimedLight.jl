meteo: meteo.csv         # Path to the meteo file

photosynthesis: false    # compute photosynthesis and energy balance ?
sky_sectors: 6           # Must be either 1, 6, 16, 46, 136 or 406
all_in_turtle: true      # false: direct radiation is computed using the true sun position; true: direct radiation is computed using sky sectors

scattering: false        # true: compute multiple scattering
pixel_size: 30           # Size of the side of the pixel, relates to the number of rays sent in the scene for each direction (cm pixels-1). Decrease value for increased resolution.
cache_pixel_table: false # true: pixel tables are cached on disc instead of kept in memory (slower but use less memory + allow to reuse them).
toricity: true           # Make the scene toric (if false, increase the plot boundaries so all components are sampled)
